#
# General principles:
# 
# If an application request has no preferred values, defaults should be set.
# If there is a vacant Instance which is suitable, use it up.
# If the application can or should not be colocated, then request a new instance for it.
# If there is a suitable existing server, with less then N apps on it, and you can colocate, do it
# If there is no suitable colo server, request a new one
#
# If a new server is requested, and the app is colocatable, create an instance
# If a new server is requested and the app is not colocatable, find a minimal suitable flavour, and create an instance.
